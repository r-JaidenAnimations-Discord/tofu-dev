# Tofu Dev Bot

This is the bot that watches over the 'test subjects' in the Tofu dev server. It isn't feature rich or anything. It's literally only for the dev server purposes. Don't expect too much to happen here.

In short, this is a _heavily_ stripped down and slightly modified version of Tofu Bot. It has the same command/event handler and boilerplate code. If you want to do anything with it, go ahead. Though i do recommend checking Tofu Bot for that instead, as it's more maintained and kept up to date more often.
